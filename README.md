## Experience

### Makers Academy&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(May 2020 cohort)</i>

<div><p><i>The skills and processes practised at Makers include </i></p></div>

* Following the TDD process, I write robust code that grows from simplicity, giving me a solid footing for any new project, language or framework, such as our first group project in Rails using Rspec and Capybara.
* Keeping code DRY means I can share readable, refactored, clear, clean code with other developers working on the project, from Node components to entire classes.  
* Adhering to Agile processes means that I am efficient and effective, the rigid structure of which aided communications during our first group project in JavaScript.
* I can learn Independently and stick to my schedule to grow successfully, as demonstrated throughout the Makers Bootcamp and in my projects post Bootcamp
* Experienced in Pair programming and Mobbing which involved cross-functional collaboration to get the team on the same page, helping build stronger connections and processes. This also built up my confidence.  
* Utilize effective Debugging process ‘Tighten loop & Get visibility’, which was very effective when working with new frameworks and languages especially Javascript and Node
* Studying and graduating during lockdown has instilled me with the skills and ability to be able to work successfully from a remote position, time management, discipline and has most importantly made me a more effective communicator.

## Skills

### Teamwork

I value above all else my ability to thrive in teamwork, communication is the key to successful teamwork. During Makers group projects we used Agile principles to coordinate and plan our project schedule and day-to-day responsibilities. As my confidence grew I took to the role of Leader and Scrum-master (think of these as Captain and manager of a football team), eager to face the challenge, delegating time and prioritizing team resources in order to reach deadlines. I believe that a happy team is a successful team. I take care of myself and reach out to others in need, utilizing my emotional intelligence.

### Learner

Acknowledgement of my abilities takes a level of self-awareness. New programming languages and concepts are seldom quick or straightforward to learn, in the beginning a lot of trial and error is involved. Defining myself as a learner is a bit of a superpower. I acknowledge the fact that processes need to be followed and working deliberately and intentionally, from a base of understanding building up my knowledge. While working remotely I have become much more resourceful. I know where to go and who to ask for help and as a result I move through blockages and focus on learning faster.

### Problem Solver

It used to be that when I got stuck on a problem I would either obsessed and obsessed some more or give up but Makers has transformed my problem-solving abilities, transforming me into a much more effective problem solver. I have cultivated a healthy mindset and strategies when I do get stuck. Now I approach problems with the same focus and dedication while allowing myself to breath and knowing when to step away. Always taking steps forward, despite how small.

Managing the loose wholefoods department saw me take on numerous roles and responsibilities including:

* Ordering, stocking, cleaning, being both independent and collaborative working towards a collective goal.
* Training new employees with emphasis on stocking, storage, allergens, shaped my leadership and communication skills.

* Implemented efficient procedures of topping up and ordering making it easier for fellow employees and management get much clearer visibility on the cycle of products.
* Meticulous record-keeping, written and digital-focused my accuracy and attention to detail.
* I prioritized values inline with the organisation, autonomy, solidarity and cooperation, attending all GMs with enthusiasm.


### Cafe Thrive &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(08/2017 - 04/2019)</i>

Cafe Thrive, the first and only fully vegan restaurant in Southampton. I was there from the beginning, working tirelessly at a company with a vision that I believed in.

* I worked front of the house, 9-hour shifts, at peak times this was extremely busy, the job taught me a lot about keeping cool under pressure.
* Having to balance many roles at once grew my capacity for multi-tasking.
* I cultivated excellent communication skills with customers and colleagues, relaying information is critical to the operation of the business, always prioritizing the needs of the customer.

As a technical designer, I am not only able to conceptualise but also develop projects using various dev tools with skills in design, 2D and 3D art and logic scripting. This gives me a well-rounded cross-disciplinary understanding of all the elements that go into a large scale project. A highlight includes being junior and technical lead designer in  a team of around ten. The role saw me collaborating with outsourcers from various disciplines, building my resilience to pressure and responsibility.

## Interests

Yoga: I started my journey about two years ago hoping to help my sore back, then coming to the realisation that yoga could offer me so much more peace of mind, connectivity and clarity in a time I really needed it most. Asana, breathwork, cold-water training and yoga nidra are now part of my daily practices. I also attend kirtan, charnting, cacao ceremonies and the occasional satsang.

Wild-swimming: What started as cold water training as part of my yoga practice has turned into one of my favorite hobbies.
Rivers, the sea in Winter or Summer, the water is a beautiful place to be especially in the stillness of the morning,

Forest camping: I feel most alive in nature, wild camping is the closest I come living in harmony with the planet and myself.

Cooking: I thrive on hearty simple food made with love, I try to make the same with the occasional decadent raw dessert. I’m also a pretty accomplished sourdough baker.

Crafts and creatively: I’ve been sewing since I was a child making basic trousers and shorts, I’ve recently got a sewing machine and enjoy fixing and designing my own textiles. I also enjoy digital illustration /graphic design which I hope to do more of in the future.
