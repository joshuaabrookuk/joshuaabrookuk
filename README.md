## Experience

### Makers Academy&nbsp;&nbsp;(May 2020 cohort)

<div><p><i>The skills and processes practised at Makers include </i></p></div>

* Following the TDD process, I write robust code that grows from simplicity, giving me a solid footing for any new project, language or framework, such as our first group project in Rails using Rspec and Capybara.
* Keeping code DRY means I can share readable, refactored, clear, clean code with other developers working on the project, from Node components to entier classes.  
* Adhering to Agile processes means that I am efficient and effective the rigid structure of which aided communications and relations during our first group project in JavaScript.
* I can learn Independently and stick to my schedule to grow successfully, as demonstrated throughout the Makers Bootcamp and in my projects post Bootcamp
* Experienced in Pair programming and Mobbing which involved cross-functional collaboration to get the team on the same page, helping build stronger connections and processes. This also built up my confidence.  
* Utilize effective Debugging process ‘Tighten loop & Get visibility’, which was very effective when working with new frameworks and languages especially Javascript and Node
* Studying and graduating during lockdown has instilled me with the skills and ability to be able to work successfully from a remote position, time management, discipline and has most importantly made me a more effective communicator.

## Skills

### Teamwork

I value above all else my ability to thrive in teamwork.Communication is the key to successful teamwork. During Makers group projects we used Agile methodology to coordinate and plan our project sprints and day-to-day responsibilities. As my confidence grew I took to the role of Leader or Scum-master happy to face the challenge, delegating time and prioritizing team resources in order to reach our collective goal. A happy team is a successful team. I take care of myself and reach out to others in need utilizing the skill of emotional intelligence.


### Problem Solver

It used to be that when I get stuck on a problem I either obsess and obsess some more and potentially give up. Makers has transformed my problem-solving abilities with practices such as: TDD, ‘the cardboard programmer’/ Rubber ducking, making me into a much more effective problem solver. I have also cultivated a healthy mindset and strategies when I do get stuck. Now I approach problems with the same focus and dedication while allowing myself to breath and knowing when to step away. Always taking steps forward, despite how small.


### Learner

Acknowledgement of my abilities takes a level of self-awareness.
New programming languages and concepts might not always be quick or straightforward to learn in the beginning, a lot of trial and error is involved. Defining myself as a learner here is a bit of a superpower. I acknowledge the fact that processes need to be taken slowly and deliberately, working from a base of understanding building up my knowledge. While working remotely I have become much more resourceful. I know where to go and who to ask for help and as a result I move through blockages and focus on learning faster.

* I worked front of the house, 9-hour shifts, at peak times this was extremely busy, the job taught me a lot about keeping cool under pressure.
* Having to balance many roles at once grew my capacity for multi-tasking.
