* Keeping code DRY means I can share readable, refactored, clear, clean code with other developers working on the project, from Node components to entier classes.  
* Adhering to Agile processes means that I am efficient and effective the rigid structure of which aided communications and relations during our first group project in JavaScript.
* I can learn Independently and stick to my schedule to grow successfully, as demonstrated throughout the Makers Bootcamp and in my projects post Bootcamp
* Experienced in Pair programming and Mobbing which involved cross-functional collaboration to get the team on the same page, helping build stronger connections and processes. This also built up my confidence.
